# How to contribute to `fa-scrapper`

fa-scrapper is free software licensed under GNU GPLv3. You are more than welcome
to contribute opening Pull Requests to this repo or submitting issues.

## Submitting issues

You can use Github issues to submit bugs or ask for new features.

### Bugs

Keep in mind the following guidelines when submitting a bug report:

1. First, go through the [troubleshooting](README.md#troubleshooting) list first
   to check that it is not a known problem.
2. Check the existing issues to see if your bug has already been posted. If so,
   either upvote the issue if you have nothing relevant to add or post a comment
   with additional context. Try not to post comments if they don't add anything
   significant like "Same" or "+1".
3. If possible, do **not** post your user or list id for privacy reasons. If
   they are relevant, I would prefer if you contact me in private.
4. Provide all relevant context: operating system, locale and Python version.

### Features

Keep in mind the following guidelines when submitting a feature request:

1. Check that your feature request is not among the
   [things that will not be merged](#things-that-will-not-be-merged).
2. Check the existing issues to see if there is a similar existing feature
   request. If so, either upvote the issue if you have nothing relevant to add
   or post a comment with additional details. Try not to post comments if they
   don't add anything significant.
3. Try to be specific if possible on how the feature should work.
4. If you have the coding skills, try to do it yourself! I am here to help if
   you need assistance.

## Contributing with code

You are welcome to contribute to the code base using Pull Requests. If you
contribute, you agree to release your work under the GNU GPLv3 license.

Here are a few tips when making contributions:

1. Check that your change is not among the
   [things that will not be merged](#things-that-will-not-be-merged).
2. If the change warrants discussion you can
   [submit an issue](#submitting-issues) first proposing the new feature so that
   we can discuss any significant design aspects of it.
3. Use a descriptive title for your PR; your commits will be squashed with that
   title (modulo minor rewording/typo-fixing).
4. Make sure to reference any issues related to the PR.
5. Ensure the required status checks pass: if you think they are wrong make a
   comment about it so that I can manually check it.

## Things that will not be merged

I will **not** merge or implement any feature that makes it significantly easier
for someone to use fa-scrapper to scrape data from many FilmAffinity users
indiscriminately.
